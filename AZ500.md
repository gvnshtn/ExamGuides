# Prepping for AZ500
This is the set of resources I have used for preparing for the AZ500 exam.
The exam was updated in September 2021 and I am taking the exam in Q4 2021.
Please bear this in mind as exam materials are updated continually but may recieve major updates every six months, typically in Q1 and Q3.

## Resources
* Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies. The skills measured page is your North Star, don't distract yourself by going down avenues not explicity listed on this page as the questions must reflect these skills. Also take note of the language, verbs like implement, secure, manage have an impact on what aspects you need to focus on.  
  * [aka.ms/AZ500](https://aka.ms/az500)
  * [Skills Measured](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VC70)
* MS Learn content for the updated exam has been posted, although it does have some teething issues in terms of alignment with the Skills Measured page.
  *  [AZ-500 part-1: Manage Identity and Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/manage-identity-access/)
  *  [AZ-500 part2: Implement platform protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/implement-platform-protection/)
  *  [AZ-500 part 3: Secure your data and applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/secure-your-data-applications/)
  *  [AZ-500 part 4: Manage security operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/manage-security-operation/)
* Mark O'Shea has a solid exam guide that reflects the September 29th 2021 update:
  *  [Preparing for the AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies Exam (September 2021 Update)](https://intunedin.net/2021/10/19/preparing-for-the-az-500-microsoft-azure-security-technologies-exam-september-2021-update/)
* [Tim Warner](https://twitter.com/techtrainertim) runs an [AZ-500 Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/exam-az-500-microsoft-azure-security-technologies-crash-course/0636920360612/0636920062468/) on O'Reilly.
* The [Mark Grimes](https://twitter.com/markbgrimes) is worth a watch to help you gauge how much time you will need to prepare and what kind of process to follow.
  * [AZ-500 C.E.R.T YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVY1cokqlbC5C5EnjTTJAZFpX9I4FT8Uy)
* Pluralsight has their content if that works for you
  * [Microsoft Azure Security Technologies (AZ-500)](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-security-technologies-az-500)
What works for some may not work for others. But I can recommend three things:

1. Read '[Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013/ref=sr_1_1)' (ISBN:9780674729018).
2. Fork or print this page out and check off the docs as you move through the list.
3. As you go through the docs, have a test tenant in place and DO the things. Make sure you understand them as you go, don't just robotically click buttons assuming you'll remember what it is you did and why. You'll need that for the test.
